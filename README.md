# Project Proposal: Population Health Informatics Spring 2018

### Project Description:
Domain: Nutrition
Demographic: Children in public education system

The purpose of our project to look at how the combination of exercise and nutrition affect teenagers. There are teenagers that eat healthy but do not get exercise, as well as children who are very active but do not eat the most nutritious meals, so it would be interesting to see which factor contributes more to teenage/childhood obesity in America, as it is a nationwide problem. Also, as we are moving in a more technological age with everything becoming digitized, people have less incentives to go outside and be active, so we are looking at ways technology can be used to promote a more active lifestyle to see if this will help with promoting awareness and prevention of childhood/teenage obesity.

#### Research Question: Going into a more technical age, is there a better way of motivating children to moderate their eating and exercise?

#### Techniques to Employ When Answering Research Question:
Comparing results to already existing public health policies/private organization efforts 
Check to see impact given their independent data to our set over time
Look into washington state specific policies compared to the national efforts

#### Three Questions w/ Chosen Data Set:
1. Do kids reach the appropriate amount of fruits and vegetables in their diet as recommended by nutritionists?
2. Does exercise or diet play a more prominent role in the child obesity epidemic in America?
3. How does Washington state compare with child nutrition levels opposed to national levels?

The data which will be extracted concerning the above questions in the domain of nutrition would go towards helping a plethora of individuals involved with or have a direct stake in the nutritional well-being and health of a child. More specifically, in terms of a target audience our findings would be most impactful to those in the State of Washington Department of Education who oversee policy implementation Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction’s Food and Nutrition Services. The Food and Nutrition Service administers several programs that provide healthy food to children including the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program, Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, and Special Milk Program. Each of these programs helps fight hunger and obesity by reimbursing organizations such as schools, child care centers, and after-school programs for providing healthy meals to children. They are the ones who work with the carefully developed budgets from the DoE for meal programs within public schools, and from the effects of what our group finds from the original data set they may learn that they could potentially be reaching out to appropriate NGO’s for assistance if needed. Additionally from the data we coerce, it may be that they start to reform their current handling of such a dense situation and can lead to a huge positive impact on a child’s life which will help them along the way of their educational journey. As any educator knows, school is more than a learning institution, it is a second or even first home for many: providing students with fundamental resources for success will fulfill the goal of our target audience as they seek information through our findings.

### Technical Description:
Our final deliverable will consist of a multi-tabbed Shiny application answering our research question and providing information based on the questions that we chose to ask. Our shiny application will utilize various libraries as we explore both our dataset and our domain. As we clean and wrangle our data, we anticipate using various libraries, such as Hmisc (since some of our data will be in SAS files), dplyr for data wrangling, and survey as many parts of our data is reflected through surveys due to the nature of our domain. After we conduct our data wrangling, we will create compelling visualizations which will allow our user to understand and explore our research questions, and be able to analyze our findings. We will likely use ggplot2 for these visualizations, but if any more complex visualizations arise, then we will explore various libraries and use the one that fits best for our project.
